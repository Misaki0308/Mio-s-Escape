Welcome to Mioâ€™s Mansion! This is an interactive escape game that involves typing, drawing,
and shape memorization. Players take on the role of Mio, who is trapped in a haunted mansion
and must collect various shapes to unlock a special lock and escape. Starting in the attic,
players must complete all three levels to reach the bottom door, where they will need to solve
the lock to escape the mansion. In each level, players must defeat ghosts to collect shapes that
will be used for the lock at the end of the third level. The first game mechanic involves typing the
corresponding alphabetical letters to hit the targeted ghosts. The second mechanic requires
players to trace over the corresponding shape at each level. After all three levels are complete,
you will turn the lock to the corresponding shapes you received after completing each level.
Finally, you will be able to escape the haunted mansion.
